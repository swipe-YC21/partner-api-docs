## Welcome

Thank you for choosing Swipe API for your integration needs. This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating with Swipe's powerful API.

To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Create an account on [Swipe](https://app.getswipe.in) if you haven't already done so. This will give you access to the Swipe API and other features.

2. Reach out to our customer support team to generate an API key for your account. They will provide you with the necessary credentials to authenticate your API requests.

3. Once you have your API key, you can test it using our API playground. Visit [API Playground](https://developers.getswipe.in/api-reference/document/create-a-document). Enter your API key and explore the available endpoints to ensure everything is working correctly.

4. If you need to customize your invoice templates, settings, or any other configurations, you can do so from the [https://app.getswipe.in](https://app.getswipe.in) portal. Simply log in to your account and navigate to the respective sections to make the desired changes.

5. With the Swipe API, you can create, edit invoices, manage customer data, and utilize other Swipe features. We are continuously integrating all Swipe features with the Swipe API as well.

6. Finally, once your integration is complete, you can use the [https://app.getswipe.in](https://app.getswipe.in) portal to view and manage all your invoices and related data. This provides a convenient way to track and monitor your transactions.
