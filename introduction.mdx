## Swipe API

The Swipe API allows developers to integrate Swipe's invoicing capabilities into their systems, making it fast and seamless to create invoices. With the API, you can easily generate invoices, manage invoice data, and automate the invoicing process.

To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Create an account on [Swipe](https://app.getswipe.in) if you haven't already done so. This will give you access to the Swipe API and other features.

2. Visit [API integration](https://app.getswipe.in/user?tab=api_integration) section to generate your API key. Copy the API key and keep it secure as it will be used to authenticate your requests to the Swipe API.

3. Once you have your API key, you can test it using our API playground. Visit [API Playground](https://developers.getswipe.in/api-reference/document-v2/create-a-document). Enter your API key and explore the available endpoints to ensure everything is working correctly.

4. If you need to customize your invoice templates, settings, or any other configurations, you can do so from the [Swipe portal](https://app.getswipe.in/list/sales?settings=document_settings). Simply log in to your account and navigate to the respective sections to make the desired changes.

5. With the Swipe API, you can create, edit invoices, manage customer data, and utilize other Swipe features. We are continuously integrating all Swipe features with the Swipe API as well.

6. Finally, once your integration is complete, you can go to [Dashboard](https://app.getswipe.in) to view and manage all your invoices and related data. This provides a convenient way to track and monitor your transactions.

Feel free to explore the rest of this documentation for detailed information on the available API endpoints and how to use them effectively.

## Testing the API

To test the Swipe API, you will need to provide the necessary authentication token and fill in all the required fields. Follow these steps:

2. Open the API playground by visiting [API Playground](https://developers.getswipe.in/api-reference/document/create-a-document).
3. In the playground, locate the authorization field and paste your API key.
4. Fill in all the other required fields for the specific API endpoint you want to test.
5. Click the "Send" button to make the API request and see the response.
